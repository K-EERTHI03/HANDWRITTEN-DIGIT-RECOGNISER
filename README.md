A handwritten digit recognizer is a technology that can identify and categorize handwritten numbers. It uses algorithms and models to analyze the patterns in handwritten digits, allowing it to accurately determine the digit represented in an image. This technology is often used in tasks like converting handwritten notes into digital text or recognizing numbers on envelopes for automated sorting.
